**These parts should only be taken as an example only.**

## Known Issues
* All parts have undergone many revisions without good tracking of which ones are on what system so there is no guarantee that they all even fit together. 
* The fasteners for the NuC were designed to fit a F600 and don't fit tightly on the F450.
* The TX2 case holes don't quite line up with the center of the plate it screws into
* The NuC case doesn't fit the current generation of NuCs
* We have found the landing gear placement on our system had a bad habit of breaking the base pcb on hard landings. To overcome this it was replaced with base.SLDPRT that was cut out of 2mm thick carbon fiber.
